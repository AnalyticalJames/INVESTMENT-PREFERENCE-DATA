Investment Behavior & Preference Analysis (Excel Analysis)
Project Overview

This project analyzes individual investment behavior and preferences using Excel.
The goal here for me is to understand how demographics, age groups, expected returns, and investment duration influence investment choices, decision factors, and savings objectives
The final output that as given is an interactive Excel dashboard with slicers and KPI cards that allow users to explore investment patterns dynamically.

Business Questions Addressed

What investment avenues are preferred by different genders?
How do investment preferences vary across age groups?
What factors (returns, risk, lock-in period) influence investment decisions at different life stages?
How do savings objectives change with investment duration?
Why do investors choose mutual funds based on expected return ranges?
What are the key summary KPIs that describe overall investment behavior?

Dataset Description
The dataset contains survey responses related to:
Demographics: Gender, Age
Investment Participation: Mutual Funds, Equity Market, Bonds, Fixed Deposits, PPF, Gold
Behavioral Factors: Investment factors, objectives, duration, monitoring frequency
Preferences & Motivations: Reasons for choosing specific investment instruments
Information Sources: Media, consultants, internet, etc.
Custom age groups were created to support life-stage analysis:

21–25: Early Adulthood
26–30: Established Adulthood
31–35: Experienced Adulthood

Tools & Techniques Used

Key Insights - For me the main insights are
Younger investors show a stronger inclination toward equity-based and high-return instruments.
Return expectations increasingly influence investment decisions as investors mature.
Long-term investment durations are strongly associated with retirement and wealth creation goals.
Mutual fund investors with higher expected returns prioritize better returns and diversification.
Risk sensitivity varies noticeably across different age groups.
